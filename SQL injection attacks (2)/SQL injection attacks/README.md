### üõ°Ô∏è **SQL Injection Protection**

CivicTrack implements multiple layers of protection against SQL injection attacks:

#### **1. Prisma ORM Protection**
- **Type-safe queries**: All database operations use Prisma's type-safe query builder
- **Parameterized queries**: Automatic query parameterization prevents injection attacks
- **Schema validation**: Runtime type checking ensures data integrity
- **No raw SQL**: Zero direct SQL queries eliminate injection vectors
