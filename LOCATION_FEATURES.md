# Location-Based Filtering Features - CivicTrack

## 🎯 Overview

CivicTrack implements neighborhood-focused civic issue tracking with **real-time location-based filtering**. Users can only view and interact with civic issues within their immediate neighborhood zone.

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**

### 🌍 **Real-Time Location Detection**
- **GPS-based positioning**: Automatically detects user's current location
- **Real-time updates**: Continuously monitors location changes 
- **Fallback handling**: Uses default NYC location if GPS unavailable
- **Enhanced error handling**: Detailed error messages for location failures

### 📍 **Neighborhood Zone Restrictions**
- **3km default radius**: Issues visible within 3-5km radius only
- **Distance calculation**: Haversine formula for accurate geo-distance
- **Dynamic filtering**: Real-time filtering based on user movement
- **Visual radius indicator**: Blue circle on map showing coverage area

### 🔒 **Privacy & Limitations**
- **No external browsing**: Cannot view issues outside neighborhood
- **Location-required**: Must have location access for full functionality
- **Automatic filtering**: Issues filtered immediately on location change
- **Neighborhood-first approach**: Encourages local civic engagement

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### Core Functions:
```typescript
// Distance calculation using Haversine formula
calculateDistance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2) → distance in km

// Real-time filtering
getIssuesWithinRadius(issues, userLat, userLng, radius) → filtered issues

// Location watching
watchPosition() → continuous location updates
```

### Key Components:
- **MapView**: Main component with location filtering
- **LeafletMap**: Visual map with radius circle
- **ReportForm**: Location-aware issue reporting
- **LocationUtils**: Reusable location utilities

---

## 🎛 **User Experience**

### Location Status Indicator:
```
📍 Your Neighborhood
└── 📍 Location detected
└── 🔍 Showing issues within 3km radius  
└── 📊 X civic issues found nearby
```

### Real-time Updates:
- Issues appear/disappear as user moves
- Radius circle updates on map
- Status indicators reflect current state
- Smooth transitions between locations

---

## ⚡ **Performance Features**

### Optimized Filtering:
- **Pre-filtering**: Issues filtered before UI rendering
- **Efficient calculations**: Optimized distance algorithms
- **Caching**: Location cached for 5 minutes
- **Background updates**: Non-blocking location watches

### Error Resilience:
- **Permission denied**: Graceful fallback to default location
- **Timeout handling**: 10-second timeout for GPS requests
- **Connection issues**: Works offline with cached data
- **Browser compatibility**: Falls back for unsupported browsers

---

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### Location Constants:
```typescript
DEFAULT_RADIUS_KM: 3      // Default neighborhood radius
MAX_RADIUS_KM: 5          // Maximum allowed radius  
MIN_RADIUS_KM: 1          // Minimum allowed radius
DEFAULT_LOCATION: NYC     // Fallback location
```

### Geolocation Options:
```typescript
enableHighAccuracy: true   // Use GPS for precision
timeout: 10000             // 10-second timeout
maximumAge: 300000         // 5-minute cache
```

## 🚦 **Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ✅

### ✅ **Completed Features:**
- [x] Real-time GPS location detection
- [x] 3-5km neighborhood radius filtering  
- [x] Distance calculation (Haversine formula)
- [x] Issues auto-filter on location change
- [x] Visual radius indicator on map
- [x] Location status in sidebar
- [x] Enhanced error handling
- [x] Background location watching
- [x] Fallback for location access denied
- [x] Mobile-responsive location features

### 🎯 **Result:**
Users now experience true **neighborhood-focused civic engagement** where:
- Only nearby issues are visible (3-5km radius)
- Real-time location updates filter content automatically  
- Cannot browse or interact with reports outside their zone
- Visual feedback shows their neighborhood coverage area
- Location-aware issue reporting respects same boundaries

The feature successfully implements the core requirement: **"Only civic issues reported within a 3-5 km radius are visible to the user, based on GPS or manual location. Users cannot browse or interact with reports outside their neighborhood zone."**
