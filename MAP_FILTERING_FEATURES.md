## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Map Functions**:
```typescript
// Distance calculation using Haversine formula
calculateDistance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2) → distance in km

// Location-based filtering with distance
getIssuesWithinRadius(issues, userLat, userLng, radius) → filtered issues

// Real-time location tracking
watchPosition() → continuous location updates
```

### **Filtering Logic**:
```typescript
// Multi-layered filtering system
1. Location Filter: Filter by GPS radius (1km/3km/5km)
2. Category Filter: Filter by issue category
3. Status Filter: Filter by resolution status  
4. Search Filter: Filter by text in title/description
```

### **State Management**:
```typescript
const [locationRadius, setLocationRadius] = useState(3)
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  category: "all",
  status: "all", 
  search: "",
  distance: "3" // New distance filter
})
```
